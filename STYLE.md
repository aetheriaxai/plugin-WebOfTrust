FIXME: I've been obeying a consistent style when writing WoT/FT code for many years.  
Write it down here.
# Web of Trust / Freetalk code style guideline

WoT **thoroughly** follows this style guideline, please keep obeying it:

The guideline has been written by `xor-freenet` *after* a decade of his work on the WoT codebase to
accurately describe the style he had been following.

Hence WoT is *not* in the typical sad situation of picking an arbitrary style guideline off the
Internet after having tons of code at hand already and then trying to force the codebase into it
while it violates the guideline in most places.  
Instead, *the guideline* was forced to reflect the codebase's as-is situation and thus it hopefully
should already be obeyed in most places.

Therefore `xor-freenet` hereby kindly requests for this guideline to be kept as-is and followed in
perpetuity to keep the codebase maximally coherent.

Freetalk, where `xor-freenet` also wrote most of the code, shall use the guideline of WoT, too, to
avoid having to duplicate it in Freetalk's repository.
