CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChooseCreateOrRestore.RestoreRadio=I have used the private key with Web Of Trust in the past. Please download my old data from the network.
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChooseCreateOrRestore.Text.1=You asked Web of Trust to use an already existing secret key for your identity. If you have previously used this key with Web of Trust, it can download and restore a backup of your identity. However it is not possible for WoT to determine on its own whether you have used the key for an identity already, so please tell us:
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChooseCreateOrRestore.Text.2=${bold}VERY IMPORTANT WARNING:${/bold} Using the wrong option here ${bold}can permanently break your identity!${/bold} If you are not sure, go back and instead choose to create a new, random secret key!

CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.Header=Trust list
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.PublishTrustListCheckbox=Publish trust values given by this identity
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.Text1=Trust lists are the ${bold}foundation of Web of Trust${/bold}. Your trust list allows you to publish ${bold}trust values${/bold} you have set for the identities of other users. A trust value can be between -100 and +100. By this you tell whether you consider the content which an identity has published as spam. You should only assign negative values if someone posts spam or assigns negative values to other identities without a good reason. The purpose of the trust system is ${bold}not to punish authors for having a different opinion than you have${/bold}. Please respect that when assigning trust values.
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.Text2=For identities which you did not rate yourself, Web of Trust will accumulate trust values from other identities' trust lists. Similar to an election it will produce a ${bold}computed trust${/bold} from those. Same as with a trust value you have assigned yourself, identities with a negative computed trust will be ignored. But trust values which you did assign yourself will always overwrite the vote of the community.
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.Text3=Here you can choose whether Web of Trust should publish the trust values which you assign with your identity. It is generally a good idea because it helps the other users. However you can tell Web of Trust not to publish your trust list if you are concerned about your anonymity. You should do this if you use multiple identities with similar trust lists.
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChoosePreferences.TrustList.Text4=${bold}Warning:${/bold} It is possible that your local laws require you to remove illegal content if you have the technical ability to do so. Those laws could result in punishment if you do not publish a trust list which gives a negative rating to publishers of illegal content. Because of this we recommend you not to tell anyone in real-life which Web of Trust identities you are using.

CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChooseURI.InsertUri=Secret key
CreateOwnIdentityWizardPage.Step.ChooseURI.Text=The secret key of your identity is a cryptographic password which uniquely identifies your identity on the network. You can tell Freenet to generate a new, random secret key for you. Alternatively, you can enter an already existing, old key. The option to use an old key is useful if you want to restore a backup of an old identity. Also, an old key can be used if you already have a homepage on Freenet and want to use the same key for you WoT-identity.

DeleteOwnIdentityPage.IdentityDeleted.Text1=The identity was deleted.
DeleteOwnIdentityPage.IdentityDeleted.Text2=${bold}ATTENTION:${/bold} To ensure leftover information about the identity is deleted from the database, it will be defragmented after the next restart. If you are concerned about that, restart Web of Trust now. Notice: The current version of Web of Trust is not capable of encrypting its database - even if Freenet is configured to do so. As defragmentation does not guarantee that your operating system erases the old storage space of the database on your hard disk, information about your ownership of the Identity might thus stay on the hard disk. If this is very dangerous for you, then after the restart please use a special tool for securely erasing the free space of hard disks.

LoginPage.Welcome.Text1=Web of Trust is a decentralized system for creation of so-called "identities". Identities are like accounts for Freenet services which use Web of Trust. However, unlike regular Internet accounts, WoT is based on Freenet to ensure that your identities are ${bold}anonymous${/bold}.
LoginPage.Welcome.Text2=WoT allows rating other user's identities for spam filtering. Identities publish lists of other known identities. There they assign ratings of trustworthiness. Identities with low ratings are ignored by WoT and the programs built upon it. Negative ratings shall be assigned for sending spam - but ${bold}not due to differences of opinions!${/bold}
LoginPage.Welcome.Text3=If you create multiple identities, they will appear towards the public as if they were different persons. But watch out to not post anything which links your identities with each other. ${bold}Also, an attacker may be able to associate identities if they're always online at the same time. This is especially the case if your Freenet is not constantly online.${/bold} This is because while your Freenet is not running, WoT cannot update any of your identities, which gives them shared behavior.
